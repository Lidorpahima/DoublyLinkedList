#DoublyLinkedList#
The DoublyLinkedList is a Java implementation of a doubly linked list data structure. It provides an efficient way to store and manipulate a collection of elements.

Features
Insertion: You can add elements to the list at the beginning, end, or at any specific position within the list.
Deletion: Elements can be removed from the list, including the first, last, or any specific position.
Traversal: You can traverse the list in both forward and backward directions, allowing easy access to elements.
Size: The size of the list can be determined, which tells you the number of elements currently stored in the list.
Empty Checking: You can check whether the list is empty or not.
Usage
To use the DoublyLinkedList:

Import the DoublyLinkedList class into your Java program.
Create an instance of the DoublyLinkedList by specifying the type of elements it will store.
Use the available methods such as insert, delete, traverse, getSize, and isEmpty to perform operations on the list.
Feel free to explore the methods provided by the DoublyLinkedList class and customize them according to your specific needs.

For detailed information on how to use the DoublyLinkedList, please refer to the documentation or comments within the code.
