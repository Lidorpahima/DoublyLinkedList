Welcome to my repository!
Here, you'll find a collection of projects I worked on during my first year of studies. Each folder represents a different project focusing on Java object-oriented programming.

Project Structure
The repository is organized into separate folders, with each folder dedicated to a specific project. Within each project folder, you'll find the relevant source code files, documentation, and any additional resources associated with the project.

Overview
During my first year, I delved into various aspects of object-oriented programming using Java. These projects allowed me to gain hands-on experience and apply the fundamental principles of software development, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.


Getting Started
If you're interested in exploring any of these projects, feel free to navigate to the respective project folders. Within each folder, you'll find detailed instructions on how to run the project and any prerequisites or dependencies required.

Contribution and Feedback
I'm always open to feedback and suggestions! If you have any ideas or improvements related to any of the projects or code snippets, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your input is highly appreciated.

Thank you for visiting my repository and taking the time to explore my first-year projects. I hope you find them insightful and informative.
